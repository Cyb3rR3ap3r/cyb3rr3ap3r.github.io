      <p>  Hi, my name is Trevor Isenberg aka Cyb3rR3ap3r.  I am an IT professional looking to move into the CyberSecurity field.  I want to give back to the InfoSec community so I decided to start this blog that will host various CTF walkthroughs as well as other interesting posts related to InfoSec.</p>
      
      <p>  My hope is this blog will be a good source for people to come and potentially learn a new skill or trick that could help build their skillset.  I hope you find this useful and please feel free to reach out on Twitter/Linkedin or check out my GitHub if you want to see some badly coded projects I am working on. (All linked at bottom of page) </p>
