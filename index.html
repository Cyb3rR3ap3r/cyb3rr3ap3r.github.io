      <p>  Hi, my name is Trevor Isenberg aka Cyb3rR3ap3r.  I am currently an IT professional looking to move into the CyberSecurity field.  I want to give back to the InfoSec community so I decided to start this blog website that will host various CTF walkthroughs as well as other interesting blog posts related to InfoSec.</p>
      <p>  What makes these CTF Walkthroughs different is it will not only walk you through the path to get root but will also include a sample pentest report detailing potenital other mis configurations that would be reported if the machine was on a real network. </p>
      <p>  I decided to do this as a way to work on my report writing skills as well as training my methodology to look at all potential mis configurations instead of finding one path and stopping.  I hope you find this useful and please feel free to reach out on Twitter/Linkedin or check out my GitHub for badly programming projects I have worked on (All linked at bottom of page) </p>
