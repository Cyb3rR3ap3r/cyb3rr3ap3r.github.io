      <p>  Hi, my name is Trevor Isenberg aka Cyb3rR3ap3r.  I am currently an IT professional looking to move into the CyberSecurity field.  I want to give back to the InfoSec community so I decided to start this blog that will host various CTF walkthroughs as well as other interesting posts related to InfoSec.</p>
      <p>  So what makes these CTF Walkthroughs different then others you may find?  Each walkthrough will include a sample pentest report that will outline all potenital vulnerabilities that machine my have (At least the ones I can find).  </p>
      <p>  I decided to do thias as a way to work on my report writing skills as well as training my methodology to look at all potential mis-configurations instead of just finding one path and stopping.  I hope you find this useful and please feel free to reach out on Twitter/Linkedin or check out my GitHub for badly coded projects I am working on.
